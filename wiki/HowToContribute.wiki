#summary How to contribute to the Testability Explorer

== Philosophy ==

The purpose of the TE is to show/teach developers how to write a more testable code. In that sense it is very important that the TE codebase itself shows how to write good testable code and focuses on tests which prove the TE works.

== Expectations ==

  * [http://home.hevery.com:5678/job/Testability-Explorer/ Hudson Continuous Build].
  * We aim to keep the build green(blue) all of the time. So if you break it revert your change and try to fix the problem before you submit it back. 
  * We aim to make sure that any green(blue) build is releasable build. Therefore never check in anything which makes the build pass but actually breaks the product.
  * All of the code is fully tested with with at least 80% test coverage. Preferably test-driven.
  * Most of our tests are of unit-test kind. (ie small tests focusing on a class or two at a time.)
  * Before you commit (or if you don't have commit rights) please have others do review on [http://codereview.appspot.com/] and cc/email [mailto:testability-explorer@googlegroups.com testability-explorer@googlegroups.com]
